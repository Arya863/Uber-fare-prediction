# Uber Fare Prediction â€“ ML Project

This project was developed as part of a virtual internship with **MentorMind**, co-certified by **UBER**. The objective was to build a machine learning model that predicts the fare amount for cab rides using historical trip data.

## Project Highlights

- Built a **Decision Tree Regression** model.
- Engineered features using **geolocation** and **temporal data**.
- Achieved **87% prediction accuracy**.
- Tools used: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks`: Contains the full EDA and model-building process.
- `data`: Provided on Mentormind Platform
- `src`: Source code (if applicable)

## Results

The model supports optimized fare pricing and could enhance route planning and profitability for ride-hailing services.

## Future Work

- Try ensemble models like Random Forest, XGBoost.
- Deploy as a web service using Flask/Streamlit.
